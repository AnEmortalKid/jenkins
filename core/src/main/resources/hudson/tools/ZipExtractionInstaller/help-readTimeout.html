<div>
    Sets the read timeout to a specified timeout, in milliseconds. A non-zero value specifies the timeout when reading from Input stream when a connection is established to the archive.
    If the timeout expires before there is data available for read, a java.net.SocketTimeoutException is raised.
    A timeout of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout.
